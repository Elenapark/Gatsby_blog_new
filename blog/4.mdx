When you build your site, Gatsby looks at the page components in your src/pages directory and creates new pages for your site.

src/pages/index.js lives at the / route.
src/pages/blog.js lives at the /blog route.
src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js gets turned into multiple routes - one for each MDX node in the data layer.
Gatsby uses the MDX node with slug my-first-post to build a page that lives at the /my-first-post route.
Gatsby uses the MDX node with slug another-post to build a page that lives at the /another-post route.
Gatsby uses the MDX node with slug yet-another-post to build a page that lives at the /yet-another-post route.
