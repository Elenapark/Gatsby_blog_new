## Frontmatter

With gatsby-plugin-mdx, you can also add frontmatter to your MDX files.
Frontmatter is **additional metadata** about your file.

It won’t be rendered on your page,
but it’s a way for you to add some extra details about your content.
For example, you might store your post title or the date it was published.
